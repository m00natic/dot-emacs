Poor Andersson - had to play until move 40 (which he is so unfamiliar
with). This bad guy Solodovnichenko just kept pressing and pressing
until the draw was obvious - to him. Andersson is much better at
that. He spots draws long before and really knows when to stop
playing. And everyone has to admit that 18 or 14 moves are too much
anyway. But Andersson loves his fans and likes to play OTB that's why
he sits down at the board and makes some moves though it's completely
unnecessary. You may ask why and I will tell you: Andersson solved
chess and knows that it's a draw. And as a real sportsman he still
travels to tournaments instead of simply sending a postcard with all
the results correctly predicted (4.5/9 with a draw against
everyone). Andersson, you are my hero!
